The easiest way to augment DOM builtin elements:

  * **No polyfills needed**, all modern browsers just work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
  * elements can be either created from scratch or upgraded on demand for **graceful hydration**
  * fits into 226 bytes (runtime) or 576 bytes (default) once served minified via default brotli settings (283 runtime or 666 via default gzip settings)

### Example - A more secure password field:

This example [can be tested live](https://webreflection.github.io/nonchalance/test/) and it just scratches the surface of what is possible to do with this extremely tiny, yet powerful, module.

```js
// const createRegistry = require('nonchalance');
import createRegistry from 'nonchalance';

// the default export accepts optionally a `globalThis` like
// context for all those environments that don't have a native DOM.
// Such registry can expose qualified classes names plus a `document` reference
// that will be used to create elements.
const HTML = createRegistry();

// extend any element to create, or upgrade, custom elements
// from a registry that shares nothing with the global context
class Password extends HTML.Input {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
    this.type = 'password';
  }
  // avoid malicious scripts easily retrieving any password
  get value() {
    return '********';
  }
  // demo case: still use the native `value` when password is set
  set value(secret) {
    super.value = secret;
  }
}

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <form>
    <input type="text" name="user" placeholder="user">
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="password">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
`;

// upgrade the desired element via new ClassType
new Password(document.querySelector('[type="password"]'));

// or create a new instance
const secret = Object.assign(new Password, {
  name: 'pass',
  value: Math.random(),
  placeholder: 'runtime password'
});

const form = document.querySelector('form');
form.insertBefore(secret, form.lastElementChild);
```

## F.A.Q.

<details>
  <summary><strong>How does it work?</strong></summary>
  <div>

Combining the [custom-function](https://github.com/WebReflection/custom-function#readme) module and optionally the [proxied-html-constructors](https://github.com/WebReflection/proxied-html-constructors#readme) one, it is possible to *upgrade* any sort of element without ever facing the *Illegal Constructor* error that shows up any time a natural `class extends HTMLSomethingElement {}` intent causes, when such class is not defined as globally shared `customElements` registry.

Not only there's nothing globally shared through this module on the global context, every awkward extra work to have builtin extends is completely unnecessary:

  * new or passed elements always preserve their prototype root chain
  * no extra attributes or clashing names can ever happen

On top of that, because any *HTML registry* can be created per each module or project to share among its components, it's also possible to pass to such *registry* creation any fake or mocked `globalThis` like environment, with at least a `document` field that exposes a `createElement(tagName)` method, and one or more classes the project is meant to test, such as `HTMLElement` and/or any other needed for such project to succeed.

However, since this module primary target is the *DOM*, the `globalThis` reference is used as sensible default but that still does not mean anything is shared around registries created through the default export.

  <summary><strong>Does hydration affect the element state?</strong></summary>
  <div>

**No**. The way `custom-function` works can be summarized as such:

```
# a native <p> protoype chain
HTMLParagraphElement -> HTMLElement -> Element -> Node

# a <p> passed to new (class CustomP extends HTML.P {})
CustomP -> HTMLParagraphElement -> HTMLElement -> Element -> Node

# a <p> passed to class AnotherP extends CustomP {}
AnotherP -> CustomP -> HTMLParagraphElement -> HTMLElement -> Element -> Node
```

In few words, creating an element through `new AnotherP` or upgrading an element via `new AnotherP(liveParagraph)` simply updates the prototype chain, without requiring the element to ever leave the DOM or change its native nature, as that's preserved down the prototypal inheritance chain.

As summary: *nonchalance* registries simply upgrade elements without changing their nature, exactly the same way native builtin extends work under the hood.

  <summary><strong>Can I use this with React or other fameworks?</strong></summary>
  <div>

**Yes**. The *DOM* is the *DOM*, no matter how many indirections there are in between. Your DX might vary, accordingly with the framework features, but if *React* is what you are after, there is a tiny yet elegant and `ref` based way to promote regular JSX nodes with *nonchalance*:

```js
import referenced from 'nonchalance/ref';

// indicate the Component will be passed as reference
// Note: this is just a light Proxy that grants class integrity
// regardless of its usage in the wild
const Component = referenced(class extends HTML.Div {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
    this.addEventListener('click', console.log);
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <div ref={Component}>click me</div>,
  document.body
);
```

The `ref` utility could be also used as decorator and it doesn't affect any feature of regular *nonchalance* classes plus each element is upgraded only once so that it's safe to add listeners or logic in the constructor.

See this demo [live on codepen](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/gOdYvag?editors=0011) to play around it.

  <summary><strong>Can any element become any other?</strong></summary>
  <div>

**No**. Metaphorically speaking, *HTML* elements have both a semantic meaning and a well defined, and desired, utility once live, same way a *JS* function will be, forever, a *JS* function, even if `Object.setPrototypeOf(() => {}, Number.prototype)` happens ... can you see, or agree, how wrong is that?

This module doesn't want to, and likely cannot neither, guard against misusage of its features, so be sure that whenever an element gets upgraded, it preserves its native prototype chain behind the scene, or you're alone fighting against the *DOM* ... which is quite inconvenient, if you ask me üòÖ

In short, same way `customElements.define('my-link', class extends HTMLDivElement {}, {extends: 'a'})` makes no sense, this module trust its users non-sense classes will be avoided.

  <summary><strong>What's the difference between default, all and runtime exports?</strong></summary>
  <div>

The `nonchalance` default export (brotli 576, gzip 666) uses a pre-compiled/defined *Map* of all known, and *not deprecated* HTML tags directly from [proxied-html-constructors](https://github.com/WebReflection/proxied-html-constructors#readme) module, while the `nonchalance/all` export (brotli 682, gzip 782) exposes also obsolete or deprecated tags, using `proxied-html-constructors/all` as reference.

The strength of `proxied-html-constructors` module is that *it actually throws an error* when a not-known element is being created, so that it's easier to spot errors at build or testing time, because the related *Class* might not exist or be known ahead of time.

However, this pre-compiled *Map* doesn't come for free in terms of bytes, but it's surely the fastest and less heap greedy way to use this module.

On the other hand, if you are a "*bytes saver maniac*", the `nonchalance/runtime` alternative (brotli 226, gzip 283) doesn't use a pre-compiled *Map* and it simply retrieves once the constructor related to the desired *tag*.

That means that `HTML.Shenanigan` won't ever throw an error, but it will silently create an extend of `HTMLUnknownElement`, also allocating extra heap to access such constructor via `document.createElement(anyTag).constructor`.

If *vaporware* or *minimal working code* is your choice though, and you are confident you don't need any guard other variants provide, then `nonchalance/runtime` will kinda always work forever, with slighter extra *GC* pressure than others, and without guarantees a typo written in the extend will possibly show-up at integration testing time ... and if that's your cup of tea, go ahead with this even smaller variant ü¶Ñ

Last, but not least, please note that `nonchalance/runtime` types include all known *HTML* elements, including deprecated and obsolete ones, simply because it cannot guard anything, so that any element would be automatically enabled, even the non standard, or not existent one, beside legacy.

  <summary><strong>Why using a default export instead of a named one?</strong></summary>
  <div>

Unrelated to this module but worth clarifying here why, this *dual module* simply does the right thing: it exposes a `default export` in *ESM* and a direct `module.exports = ...` in the *CJS* world, without ugly `__esModule` workarounds or similar tricks.

The reason I didn't go for a named export in pretty much any of this module, or this module dependencies, is that everyone is *free* to decide how to name the ability to create a scoped registry, among the way to name imports from its submodule within this code.

As example, `custom-function` module is imported as `custom` callback, as it's very semantic for this module purpose, while `proxied-html-constructors` is imported as `create`, which is still very semantic for this module goal but it could be confusing to some other project when `Object.create` or `createSignal`, as example, is meant instead.

That is: this module exports a single callback used to create a *registry* that can be used to extend any *HTML* element, so that having the freedom to name such registry felt like a good use case, and an improved DX, to offer.

Yes, you can alias named imports with ease in *JS*, but why even bothering when the export is meant to be just one and implicitly cover all your possible naming conventions around your code? üòâ

  <summary><strong>Aren't builtin extends hostile or not supported in Safari?</strong></summary>
  <div>

I've talked ad nauseam [about this topic](https://webreflection.medium.com/in-favor-of-custom-elements-built-ins-bae3f40f27d5) but here the thing:

  * the success of *jQuery*, which is still the most deployed and used library out there, is based on native elements manipulation and augmentation
  * every browser but Safari/WebKit supports builtin extends and use it in the wild, signaling WebKit concerns are somehow not so relevant
  * the API specification [still mention builtin extends](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example), implying it's not really a blocker for the Web
  * with ES2015 and classes, the only troublesome constructors have always been DOM classes and their *Illegal Constructor* error ... well, it's time to say goodbye to those legacy constraints
  * with modern ES2019 features, such as private fields, the Liskov substitution argument less of a concern, as extra logic can be confined within private fields and methods, lowering the risk of collision for future elements updates

In short, if you read again the most basic `Passord` class example, it's clear that builtin extends can go way beyond, and with ease, any complex and verbose and slower *ShadowDOM* based solution, so that keep being stubborn about avoiding graceful enhancement on what's the Web we surf daily is just counter-productive, and years have to pass before everyone can actually benefit from latest overly-complicated *Shadow DOM* realm, which includes [accessibility issues](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/97#issuecomment-1424415317), constraints, limited use cases compared to builtin extends, and so on ... so here there's something that's meant to work as *ECMAScript* specification compliant, without bothering legacy DOM world and all these distracting and time consuming debates around builtin extends while the Web moves forward.

This module goal is to provide a choice that doesn't suffer any of the problems developers love to talk about builtin extends:

  * "*do I need a polyfill forever?*" no, you need 576 bytes (or just 226) plus your code to forget about this issue
  * "*will builtin extends be removed from specs?*" who cares, with just 576 bytes (or 226) libary helper you're good to go

Strawberry on top, this module would work even within oepened or closed ShadowDOM content, as long as the logic provides upgrades or uses classes programmatically.

  <summary><strong>What's with the social image?</strong></summary>
  <div>

There's nothing more liberating than being a careless kid that plays in the mud against all "*don't do that!*" thinkers.

This module somehow represents that feeling through the freedom modern JS features offer, showing an elegant, portable, and super lightweight alternative to the ever-increasing complexity offered instead by browser vendors and modern specifications, all necessary to force developers workaround the ability to simply extend builtins and preserve both simplicity and the great accessibility the Web is famous for.
